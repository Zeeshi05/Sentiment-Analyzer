# üõçÔ∏è Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis AI Project

## üöÄ Overview

In the world of e-commerce, customer reviews hold immense power. Understanding the sentiment behind reviews helps businesses improve products and customers make informed choices.  
**This project leverages machine learning to classify Amazon product reviews as Positive or Negative‚Äîinstantly and interactively!**

---

## üéØ Project Highlights

- **Two Powerful ML Models:** Logistic Regression with TF-IDF and Bernoulli Naive Bayes with Count Vectorizer.  
- **Interactive Gradio App:** Try both models live in your browser‚Äîno coding required!  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization with NLTK.  
- **Handling Imbalanced Data:** Uses Random Over Sampling for balanced training.  
- **Visual Insights:** WordCloud visualizations for positive and negative reviews.  
- **Clean & Reproducible:** Well-structured code with clear instructions.

## üß† Model Performance

| Model                   | Accuracy | Precision | Recall   | F1-Score |
| ---------------------   | -------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| Bernoulli Naive Bayes   | 94%      | High      | High     | High     |
| Logistic Regression     | 82%      | Moderate  | Moderate | Moderate |

*Bernoulli Naive Bayes generally performs better in this project.*
